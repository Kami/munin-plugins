=head1 NAME

multimemory - Munin plugin to monitor memory usage of processes. Which processes
are configured in client-conf.d

=head1 APPLICABLE SYSTEMS

Any system with a compatible ps command.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

There is no default configuration.  This is an example:

The names are used to grep with directly, after cleaning. So, this plugin
only supports very basic pattern matching. To fix: see multips

regex given as the process name, as reported by ps.
